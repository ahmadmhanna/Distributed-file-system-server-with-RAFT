### INTRODUCTION
The project  Snapchat  is  aimed  at  enabling people to  connect, share,  explore,  and  interact  exclusively through pictures. Snapchat allows non‚Äêstop and guaranteed access to the user. The system is enforced to gather, store and stream pictures by building a distributed file system that provides scalable  client operations. The fundamental task is to allow the clients to communicate with each other by transferring images  to  each  other.  This  is  achieved  through  enabling  the  client  with  the  features  of  upload and download of the images to and from the server.
